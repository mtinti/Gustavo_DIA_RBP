## Abstract
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
This analysis includes three strains that knock down different RBPs proteins (MKT1, PBP1 and CFB2) when are induced with TET (3 biological replicates each). The parental strains (GFP) without TET induction for the firsth batch (MKT1, PBP1) and second batch (CFB2) are also included.
